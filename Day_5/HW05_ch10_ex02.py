# I want to be able to call capitalize_nested from main w/ various lists
# and get returned a new nested list with all strings capitalized.
# Ex. ['apple', ['bear'], 'cat']
# return ['Apple', ['Bear'], 'Cat']
# not! ['Apple', 'Bear', 'Cat']
# Verify you've tested w/ various nestings.
# In your final submission:
#  - Do not print anything extraneous!
#  - Do not put anything but pass in main()
